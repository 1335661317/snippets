# string string string

## **Description**

> Uncle Mao is a wonderful ACMER. One day he met an easy problem, but Uncle Mao was so lazy that he left the problem to you. I hope you can give him a solution.
>
> Given a string s, we define a substring that happens exactly k times as an important string, and you need to find out how many substrings which are important strings.



## **Input**

> The first line contains an integer T (T≤100) implying the number of test cases.
>
> For each test case, there are two lines:
>
> the first line contains an integer k (k≥1) which is described above;
>
> the second line contain a string s (length(s)≤10^5).



## **Output**

> For each test case, print the number of the important substrings in a line.



## **Sample Input**

    abcabc
    3
    abcabcabcabc



## **Sample Output**

    6
    9


## **题意**
