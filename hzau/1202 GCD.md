## **Problem Description**

> Xiao Ming found the compute time of 𝐠𝐜𝐝(𝒇𝒊𝒃𝒏, 𝒇𝒊𝒃𝒏+𝟏) is the most when he learnt the 𝐠𝐜𝐝, and the result of it is always 𝒇𝒊𝒃𝟏, but he is not satisfied with the simple compute result.
>
> He wants to know what 𝐠𝐜𝐝(𝟏 + 𝑺𝒏, 𝟏 + 𝑺𝒎) equals.
>
> And 𝐠𝐜𝐝 is greatest common divisor,
>
> 𝒇𝒊𝒃𝟏 = 𝟏, 𝒇𝒊𝒃𝟐 = 𝟏, 𝒇𝒊𝒃𝒏 = 𝒇𝒊𝒃𝒏−𝟏 + 𝒇𝒊𝒃𝒏−𝟐 (𝐧 ≥ 𝟑)

## **Input Description**

> The first line is an positive integer T. (𝟏 ≤ 𝐓 ≤ 𝟏𝟎𝟑) indicates the number of test cases. In the next T lines, there are three positive integer n, m, p(𝟏 ≤ 𝐧, 𝐦, 𝐩 ≤ 𝟏𝟎𝟗) at each line.



## **Output Description**

> In each test case, output the compute result of 𝐠𝐜𝐝(𝟏 + 𝑺𝒏, 𝟏 + 𝑺𝒎) %𝒑 at one line.
